.SH NAME
ASCII time series to Mini-SEED converter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
ascii2mseed [options] file1 [file2 file3 ...]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBascii2mseed\fP converts simple ASCII time series data to Mini-SEED
format.  If an input file name is prefixed with an '@' character the
file is assumed to contain a list of input data files, see \fILIST
FILES\fP below.  All output Mini-SEED records will be written to a
specified output file.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-V         "
Print program version and exit.

.IP "-h         "
Print program usage and exit.

.IP "-v         "
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "-S         "
Include SEED blockette 100 in each output record with the sample rate
in floating point format.  The basic format for storing sample rates
in SEED data records is a rational approximation
(numerator/denominator).  Precision will be lost if a given sample
rate cannot be well approximated.  This option should be used in those
cases.

.IP "-r \fIbytes\fP"
Specify the Mini-SEED record length in \fIbytes\fP, default is 4096.

.IP "-e \fIencoding\fP"
Specify the Mini-SEED data encoding format, default is 11 (Steim-2
compression) for integer data and 4 for floats (stored uncompressed).
Other supported encoding formats include 10 (Steim-1 compression), 1
(16-bit integers) and 3 (uncompressed 32-bit integers).

.IP "-b \fIbyteorder\fP"
Specify the Mini-SEED byte order, default is 1 (big-endian or most
significant byte first).  The other option is 0 (little-endian or
least significant byte first).  It is highly recommended to always
create big-endian SEED.

.IP "-o \fIoutfile\fP"
Write all Mini-SEED records to \fIoutfile\fP, if \fIoutfile\fP is a
single dash (-) then all Mini-SEED output will go to stdout.  All
diagnostic output from the program is written to stderr and should
never get mixed with data going to stdout.

.SH LIST FILES
If an input file is prefixed with an '@' character the file is assumed
to contain a list of file for input.  Multiple list files can be
combined with multiple input files on the command line.  The last,
space separated field on each line is assumed to be the file name to
be read.

An example of a simple text list:

.nf
tspair.ascii
slist.ascii
.fi

.SH ASCII DATA
The input ASCII data are expected to start with a simple header
followed by data samples in one of two forms: a columnar sample value
listing or time-sample pairs.  The header identifies the time series
source parameters (SEED convention) along with number of samples,
sample rate, time of first sample, sample list format, sample type and
optionally the units of the samples.

Header lines are of the general form:

.nf
"TIMESERIES SourceName, # samples, # sps, Time, Format, Type, Units"
.fi

Header field descriptions:

.nf
\fBSourceName\fP: "Net_Sta_Loc_Chan_Qual", no spaces, quality code optional
\fB# samples\fP:  Number of samples following header
\fB# sps\fP:      Sampling rate in samples per second
\fBTime\fP:       Time of first sample in ISO YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.FFFFFF format
\fBFormat\fP:     'SLIST' (sample list) or 'TSPAIR' (time-sample pair)
\fBType\fP:       Sample type 'INTEGER' or 'FLOAT'
\fBUnits\fP:      Units of time-series (will not be present in Mini-SEED)
.fi

The header line should not be wrapped and must contain the spaces and
commas as specified in the general form.  The units field of the
header is optional and will not be used by ascii2mseed (there is no
place for units in Mini-SEED).  No blanks lines should exist between
the header and data samples.

The \fBSourceName\fP field identifies the source of the time series
data using the SEED name nomenclature separated by underscores.  The
data quality code is optional and defaults to 'D'.  Spaces in the
source name field are not supported.
